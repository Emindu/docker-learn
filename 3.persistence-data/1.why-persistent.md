- **Overview**: This section covers persistent data challenges and solutions in containerized environments.
  
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Immutable Infrastructure**: Containers are designed to be unchanging and disposable.
  - **Ephemeral Design**: Containers are temporary, meant to be recreated from images.

- **Topics Covered**:
  - Problems of persistent data and its origins.
  - Data volumes and bind mounts as solutions to persistent data problems.
  - Assignments on preserving database data and mounting code into containers.

- **Persistent Data Challenges**:
  - Containers are ephemeral; data created in a container might be lost if the container is removed.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: Unique data should be managed separately from application binaries.

- **Docker Solutions**:
  - **Data Volumes**: Store data outside the containerâ€™s file system, preserving data across container removals.
  - **Bind Mounts**: Share host directories/files with containers, appearing as local paths within the container.

- **Note**:
  - Containers retain changes across restarts and reboots but lose data upon removal unless managed with volumes or mounts.
