### Short Note on Bind Mounts and Persistent Data

- **Introduction**: Bind mounting maps host files/directories to container files/directories, facilitating local development with Docker.

- **Bind Mount Basics**:
  - Maps host and container directories/files to the same physical location on disk.
  - Bind mounts skip the Union File System (UFS) used by other volumes, ensuring host data remains intact when containers are deleted.
  - Files in the container are not overwritten but appear replaced by host files while the bind mount is active.

- **Usage**:
  - **Runtime Only**: Bind mounts are specified using the `docker container run` command and cannot be included in Dockerfiles.
  - **Syntax**: Use `-v /host/path:/container/path` (e.g., `-v /current/dir:/usr/share/nginx/html`). On Windows, use double slashes and the drive letter.

- **Development Benefits**:
  - Ideal for development environments where host files need to be accessed or modified by the container.
  - Enables live updates in the container by editing files on the host.

- **Example with Nginx**:
  - **Setup**: Map the current working directory into the container to serve a custom index file.
  - **Commands**:
    - `docker container run -d -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html nginx`
    - Test by editing files on the host and checking changes in the container's web server.
  - **Verification**: Comparing results with and without the bind mount to confirm correct mapping.

- **Development Efficiency**:
  - Simplifies development setups by avoiding manual environment configurations (e.g., Vagrant).
  - Allows code edits directly on the host without needing to access the container shell.

- **Conclusion**: Bind mounts streamline local development, offering an effective way to manage and persist data between host and container.
