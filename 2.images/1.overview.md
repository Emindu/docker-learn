### Overview of Docker Images

In this section, we will cover:

1. **Basics of Docker Images**:
   - **What is an Image?**: An image contains application binaries, dependencies, and metadata required to run an application. It does not include a full operating system or kernel, as the host system provides those.

2. **Finding and Managing Images**:
   - Learn how to find Docker images online and manage them once downloaded or created.

3. **Creating Images**:
   - Explore the process of building your own Docker images.

4. **Characteristics of Images**:
   - **Content**: Images include just the necessary application components and can be very small, or quite large depending on the application.
   - **Size Variability**: Images can range from a single file (e.g., static binary from Go) to multiple gigabytes (e.g., Ubuntu-based images with full stacks and dependencies).

This guide aims to clarify what makes up a Docker image, how to work with them, and the distinctions between images and virtual machines.
