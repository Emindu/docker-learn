- Image Naming: Docker images do not inherently have names but are referred to by the repository name, tag, and image ID.
Repository Naming: Official images use just the repository name (e.g., mysql), while user-specific images require a user/organization prefix (e.g., bretfisher/nginx).
- Tags: Tags serve as pointers to specific image versions, similar to Git tags. Multiple tags can point to the same image, and they must follow specific naming conventions (e.g., latest, mainline, or custom tags like testing).
- Tagging Images: You can tag an existing image using the command docker image tag <source_image> <new_image>. Tags like latest are just labels and don't inherently indicate the most recent image unless maintained that way by the user or organization.
- Uploading to Docker Hub: After tagging an image, you can push it to Docker Hub using docker push <user/repository:tag>. Make sure you are logged in (docker login) before pushing, and ensure the repository exists, or Docker will create it automatically during the push.
- Private Repositories: If you want to create a private repository, itâ€™s advisable to create it first on Docker Hub and then push your image.
