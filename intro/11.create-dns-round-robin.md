### Creating Round Robin DNS in a Docker Network

In this tutorial, we'll set up DNS Round Robin within a Docker network. Follow these steps to configure and test the DNS Round Robin behavior:

1. **Create a Docker Network**:
   - Use the following command to create a network named `dude`:
     ```bash
     docker network create dude
     ```

2. **Run Containers**:
   - Start two containers and attach them to the `dude` network. The container names are not critical for this setup:
     ```bash
     docker run -d --net dude --name container1 some_image
     docker run -d --net dude --name container2 some_image
     ```
   - The containers are running in the background without exposed ports since we are only testing within the virtual network.

3. **Verify DNS Names**:
   - To test DNS resolution within the network, use `nslookup` from an Alpine container:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm --net dude alpine nslookup search
     ```
     --rm: Ensures that the Alpine container is removed automatically after the nslookup command has finished running.
   - This command checks the DNS resolution for the name `search`, and you should see two DNS entries corresponding to the two containers.

4. **Test DNS Round Robin**:
   - Use a CentOS container to curl the DNS entry:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm --net dude centos curl -s search:9200
     ```
   - Running this command repeatedly should show that the DNS resolution alternates between the two containers, indicating Round Robin behavior. For example, you might see responses from `Interloper` and `Mr. M`.

5. **Understand DNS Behavior**:
   - Note that DNS Round Robin might not always appear perfectly balanced due to name caching and other factors. The responses may not be evenly distributed but should alternate over multiple requests.

6. **Cleanup**:
   - To remove the containers, use:
     ```bash
     docker container ls -q | xargs docker container rm -f
     ```

This setup demonstrates how DNS Round Robin works within a Docker network and how to verify its operation using basic Docker commands and container interactions.
