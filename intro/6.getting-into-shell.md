## Getting a Shell inside Containers

- 'docker container run -it' - start new container interactively
- 'docker container exex -it' - run additional command in existing container

## Used commands

- docker container run -it --name proxy nginx bash
    - doing in this way when we exit from the bash container is stoping
- docker container exec -it db bash  
    - getting into running containers shell
