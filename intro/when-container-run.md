# Running `docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx`

When you run the command `docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx`, several actions occur under the hood:

## Breakdown of the Command

1. **Image Retrieval**: 
   - If the `nginx` image is not already present on your local machine, Docker will pull the latest version of the `nginx` image from Docker Hub. This image contains the necessary files and configurations to run an Nginx web server.

2. **Container Creation**:
   - Docker creates a new container from the `nginx` image. Each container is an isolated environment that runs a specific application, in this case, Nginx.

3. **Port Mapping**:
   - The `--publish 80:80` option maps port 80 of the host machine to port 80 of the container. This means that any traffic directed to port 80 on the host will be forwarded to port 80 on the Nginx server running inside the container. The first number (80) refers to the host port, while the second number (80) refers to the container port that Nginx listens on.

4. **Container Start**:
   - The container starts running, executing the default command specified in the Nginx image, which typically includes starting the Nginx service. The Nginx server listens for incoming HTTP requests on port 80.

5. **Detached Mode (if specified)**:
   - If you were to add the `--detach` flag, the container would run in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal for other commands. Without this flag, the command runs interactively, and you would see the logs in the terminal.

6. **Network Configuration**:
   - Docker sets up the necessary network configurations to allow communication between the host and the container. It uses a bridge network by default, which isolates the container's network from the host's network.

7. **Accessing the Server**:
   - Once the container is running, you can access the Nginx server by navigating to `http://localhost` in a web browser. This will display the default Nginx welcome page, indicating that the server is operational.

8. **Container Management**:
   - You can manage the container using various Docker commands, such as `docker container ls` to list running containers, `docker container stop` to stop it, and `docker container logs` to view its logs.

This command effectively sets up a lightweight, portable web server using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and management of web applications.
