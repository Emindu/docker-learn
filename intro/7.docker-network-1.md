### Section Requirements:
	•	Basic understanding of container startup.
	•	Knowledge of TCP/IP networking (subnets, IPs, ports, firewalls).
	•	Familiarity with Docker’s command line for networking.
### Key Concepts:
	•	Container Networking: Containers connect to Docker networks, with the default being the bridge network.
	•	Docker’s -p Option: Exposes a container’s port to the host machine, forwarding traffic to the container.
	•	Networking Overview: Containers can communicate within the same network without using the -p option.
	•	Virtual Networks: Each container is attached to a virtual network, allowing internal communication and external routing via NAT firewalls.
### Advanced Networking:
	•	Multiple Networks: Containers can connect to multiple virtual networks or be isolated from networks.
	•	Docker Network Drivers: Extend Docker’s networking capabilities with third-party tools and plugins.
	•	Network Configuration: Most settings are configurable, emphasizing Docker’s “batteries included but removable” philosophy.
### Command Line Review:
	•	Port Exposing with -p: Use docker container run -p host_port:container_port to expose container ports.
	•	Inspecting Container IP: Retrieve the container’s IP address using Docker’s --format option or grep for text filtering.
	•	Bridge Network (docker0): Default virtual network for containers, allowing internal communication and external access.
